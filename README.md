# expeditionMax
See where you can go on expedition with your maxJEUNE pass.

Through the public API from SNCF, you can directly see which train is available with your pass : https://data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/tgvmax/table/

This project uses this information and shows you where you can go on a small trip, 1 to 4 days in general, to discover new cities and empty your head, without harming the planet.
